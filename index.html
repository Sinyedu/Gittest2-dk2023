  <p>Starting a new project? Make a fucking new repository for starters!</p>
  <p>Make the new repository public, if it's private, no one can see it.</p>
  <p>If you want others to work on the repository you have to invite collaborators</p>
  <p>When new changes are made, make sure to commit and push your changes for the group to see</p>
  <p>You can also make branches of your project, for when you want to make multiple things, but don't want to ruin others work</p>
  <p>Then, with a new branch you can merge it together with the rest of the project, wapam! easy collaboration</p>
